# Welcome to JavAnime!

### Module 2 - Final

#### Description ðŸ“„

In this excersice we have to make web page for search anime and have the  
possibility to put them in a favourite list. We have to use JS, CSS and HTML to make the funcionality and give some cool styles to the page.

#### Programs ðŸ“š

For that excersice I use VS Code, Jikan API to get the animes and some resources of MDN web_docs.

#### Work Method ðŸ’»

In first place I structured all the HTML, without any styles. When I had a composition I like, beginning to give some styles, I always prefer to put some colors and then begging to work with JS! I made partials and wrote the styles in differents Sass files.

#### Impressions ðŸ“ˆ

This is my first page developed with js ðŸ”¥ and it has been much more fun than it seemed at first. Now it's your turn, try the page, add a list of favorites and if you regret it, you have a button to delete everything and start over ðŸ˜º
